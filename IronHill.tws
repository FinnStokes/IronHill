VThe sun rises across the town of [[Iron Hill|IronHill]]. Gnome miners rise from their beds, heft their steam-powered pickaxes and head out of town to find their fortune. The airship [[Alatus|theAlatus]] is moored above the Trader's Hub and has been for days, causing a thriving marketplace to form in its shadow.\u000a\u000aAfter days of walking, a [[gnomish merchant|Gnome]] reaches the Trader's Hub.\u000a\u000aA [[young goblin|Goblin]] enters the township, seemingly in search of something.\u000a\u000aA shadow passes across the sun briefly as a [[knight|Knight]] passes by on the way to the marketplace.
