Iron Hill
=========

Iron Hill is a text-based game in the Pentacosm setting. Five races fight for space and dominance in the world,
against other races they fail to understand. In this game, play as three characters independently trying to further
their own goals at a market place in the gnomish town of Iron Hill.

This game was made in Twine for the Global Game Jam 2014. It explores the theme "We don't see things as they are,
we see them as we are." The three characters see each other's actions through the lens of their own beliefs and
this leads to confusion, misunderstanding and conflict.
